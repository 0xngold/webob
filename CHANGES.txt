Bugfix
~~~~~~

- Response.from_file now parses the status line correctly when the status line
  contains an HTTP with version, as well as a status text that contains
  multiple white spaces (e.g HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found). See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/250

- Response now has a new property named `has_body` that may be used to
  interrogate the Response to find out if `Response.body` is or isn't set.

  This is used in the exception handling code so that if you use a WebOb HTTP
  Exception and pass a generator to `app_iter` WebOb won't attempt to read the
  whole thing and instead allows it to be returned to the WSGI server. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/259
