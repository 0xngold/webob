Unreleased
----------

Features
~~~~~~~~

- Add the ability to return a JSON body from an exception. Using the Accept
  information in the request, the exceptions will now automatically return a
  JSON version of the exception instead of just HTML or text. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/230 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/209

Security
~~~~~~~~

- exc._HTTPMove and any subclasses will now raise a ValueError if the location
  field contains a line feed or carriage return. These values may lead to
  possible HTTP Response Splitting. The header_getter descriptor has also been
  modified to no longer accept headers with a line feed or carriage return.
  See: https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/229 and
