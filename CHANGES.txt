Bugfix
~~~~~~

- ``Response.__init__`` would discard ``app_iter`` when a ``Response`` had no
  body, this would cause issues when ``app_iter`` was an object that was tied
  to the life-cycle of a web application and had to be properly closed.
  ``app_iter`` is more advanced API for ``Response`` and thus even if it
  contains a body and is thus against the HTTP RFC's, we should let the users
  shoot themselves by returning a body. See
