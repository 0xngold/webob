Unreleased
----------

Backwards Incompatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- WebOb no longer supports Chunked Encoding, this means that if you are using
  WebOb and need Chunked Encoding you will be required to have a proxy that
  unchunks the request for you. Please read
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/279 for more background.

Feature
~~~~~~~

- webob.Request with any HTTP method is now allowed to have a body. This allows
  DELETE to have a request body for passing extra information. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/283 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/274

- Add `tell()` to `ResponseBodyFile` so that it may be used for example for
  ZipFile support. See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/117

- Allow the return from `wsgify.middleware` to be used as a decorator. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/228

Bugfix
~~~~~~

- WebOb's exceptions will lazily read underlying variables when inserted into
  templates to avoid expensive computations/crashes when inserting into the
  template. This had a bad performance regression on Py27 because of the way
  the lazified class was created and returned. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/284

- `wsgify.__call__` raised a `TypeError` with an unhelpful message, it will now
  return the `repr` for the wrapped function:
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/119

- Response.content_type removes the charset content_type parameters unless the
  new content_type is a text like type that has a charset parameter.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/261 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/130

- Response.json's json.dumps/loads are now always UTF-8. It no longer tries to
  use the charset.

- Response.__init__ will no longer set the default Content-Type on Responses
  that have no body and thus shouldn't have a Content-Type

- The Response `__init__` will by default no longer set the Content-Type to the
  default if a headerlist is provided. This fixes issues whereby
  Request.get_response() would return a Response that didn't match the actual
  response.
  See https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/261 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/205

- Cleans up the remainder of the issues with the updated WebOb exceptions that
  were taught to return JSON in version 1.6. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/237 and
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/236

- Response.from_file now parses the status line correctly when the status line
  contains an HTTP with version, as well as a status text that contains
  multiple white spaces (e.g HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found). See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/issues/250

- Response now has a new property named `has_body` that may be used to
  interrogate the Response to find out if `Response.body` is or isn't set.

  This is used in the exception handling code so that if you use a WebOb HTTP
  Exception and pass a generator to `app_iter` WebOb won't attempt to read the
  whole thing and instead allows it to be returned to the WSGI server. See
  https://github.com/Pylons/webob/pull/259
